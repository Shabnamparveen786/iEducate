                <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily provided by public schools (controlled
                    and funded by the government at three levels: central, state and local) and private schools. Under
                    various articles of the Indian Constitution, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental
                    right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is
                7:5.

                Unlike other countries Private Schools are more common among middle class families.
                At the primary and secondary level, India has a large private school system complementing the government
                run schools, with 29% of students receiving private education in the 6 to 14 age group.[10] Certain
                post-secondary technical schools are also private. The private education market in India had a revenue
                of US$450 million in 2008, but is projected to be a US$40 billion market.

            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">The primary education in India is divided into two parts, namely Lower
                Primary (Class I-IV) and Upper Primary (Middle school, Class V-VIII). The Indian government lays
                emphasis on primary education (Class I-VIII) also referred to as elementary education, to children aged
                6 to 14 years old.[40] Because education laws are given by the states, duration of primary school visit
                alters between the Indian states. The Indian government has also banned child labour in order to ensure
                that the children do not enter unsafe working conditions.[40] However, both free education and the ban
                on child labour are difficult to enforce due to economic disparity and social conditions.[40] 80% of all
                recognised schools at the elementary stage are government run or supported, making it the largest
                provider of education in the country.[41]

            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Following India's independence, a number of rules were formulated for
                the backward Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes of India. In 1960, a list identifying 405
                Scheduled Castes and 225 Scheduled Tribes was published by the central government.[165] An amendment was
                made to the list in 1975, which identified 841 Scheduled Castes and 510 Scheduled Tribes.[165] The total
                percentage of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes combined was found to be 22.5% with the Scheduled
                Castes accounting for 17% and the Scheduled Tribes accounting for the remaining 7.5%.[165] Following the
                report many Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes increasingly referred to themselves as Dalit, a
                Marathi language terminology used by B R Ambedkar which literally means "oppressed".[165]
                
                The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are provided for in many of India's educational
                programmes.[166] Special reservations are also provided for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in
                India, e.g. a reservation of 15% in Kendriya Vidyalaya for Scheduled Castes and another reservation of
                7.5% in Kendriya Vidyalaya for Scheduled Tribes.
